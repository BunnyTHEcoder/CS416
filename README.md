Creating a web page using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
In this assignment, you are given several screenshots and a description of a particular web page
to replicate. Using Bootstrap (you must use the latest Bootstrap version, 5.2), you will recreate
this web page as shown in the provided screenshot and video below. In particular, you will create
an HTML file named index.html that can be used as a home page for our CS department. You
will also create a CSS file named styles.css that contains the styles for this page. However,
unlike HW-1, you will be utilizing Bootstrapâ€™s CSS classes rather than implementing them
yourself, so styles.css should contain very few CSS rule
